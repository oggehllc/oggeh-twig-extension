# OGGEH Twig Extension

This is a free extension introduces our example implementation on top of Twig template engine, for more control over our API Response (_conditional statements, loops, and custom functionality_).

> You need a Developer Account to obtain your App API Keys, if you don't have an account, [request](https://account.oggeh.com/request) one now.

## Getting Started

1. First, you need to install Twig
```
composer require twig/twig:~2.0
```
2. Next, you need to enter your App API Key in `index.php`
```php
OGGEH::configure('domain', 'domain.ltd');
OGGEH::configure('api_key', '[APP_API_KEY]');
```
3. For local environment, you need to enter your App API Secret as well in `index.php`, and set _sandbox_ setting to `true`
```php
OGGEH::configure('api_secret', '[APP_API_SECRET]');
OGGEH::configure('sandbox', true);
```
4. Optionally, you can configure your own Frontend dictionary for translating page custom model attributes as follows:
```php
OGGEH::configure('i18n', array(
  'category'=>array(
    'en'=>'Category',
    'ar'=>'التصنيف'
  ),
  'client'=>array(
    'en'=>'Client',
    'ar'=>'العميل'
  )
));
```
5. Edit your _hosts_ file and append:
```
127.0.0.1 app.domain.ltd
```
6. Preview example template in browser at http://app.domain.ltd

## IMPORTANT

You should not use Sandbox headers in production mode to avoid blocking your App along with your Developer Account for violating our terms and conditions!
If you're planning to use this example, remove the `SandBox` header from JavaScript (_assets/js/main.js @line 70_)

## How it Works

The template has `.htaccess` file which redirects all requests at your Frontend Template to the above index file as follows:
```
http://domain.ltd/:lang/:module/:child_id/:extra_id
```

URL Segment | Description
--- | ---
domain.ltd | Your App domain as entered during creation.
:lang | URL language code (_for example: en_), this is how you pass target language to our API Requests.
:module | Represents which content model you want to retreive from your customer's content (_page, album, .. etc_).
:child_id | Represents additional filtering parameter to the selected model (_for example: page-unique-identifier_).
:extra_id | Represents an extra parameter to the selected model.

The extension maps each model from your Frontend Request URL above to an HTML template file inside the _tpl_ directory.

As of the home page, you need to keep a default HTML file _tpl/home.html_.
* You can use _tpl/404.html_ for invalid requests.
* You can use _tpl/inactive.html_ to be displayed when your App is not in production mode.

The extension supports the following functions:

Function | Description
--- | ---
call('json') | Makes stacked API request using php curl.
get('alias') | Retrives individual API response by method _alias_ defined for each request method.
trans('phrase') | Translates custom phrases defined at _index.php_.
flag('lang') | Maps the language code to a country code (_defined at locale.json_).

The extension supports the following filters:

Filter | Description
--- | ---
urldecode | Decodes URL-encoded string.

### Usage

There're 2 more files you need to keep for proper usage:

1. `tpl/api.twig`: defines global API methods, mostly reused in header and footer blocks, and extends those based on current module from URL.
2. `tpl/blocks.twig`: define both header and booter blocks to be used later on each module template.

At any given module template (`home`, `page`, `news`, `album`, `contact`, or `search`), you should keep the following structure:
```twig
{# Import global wrapper #}
{% extends 'api.twig' %}

{% block api %}
    
    {# Fetch response from method alias `app` to be used accross all blocks #}
    {% set app = get('app') %}

    {# Reuse common blocks (i.e. header and footer) #}
    {% use 'blocks.twig' %}

    {# Print header block #}
    {{ block('header') }}

    {# Print content block #}
    {% block content  %}

    	{# Your module template goes here  #}

    {% endblock %}

    {# Print footer block #}
    {{ block('footer') }}

{% endblock %}
```
The above sequence enables you to make only one stacked API request and retrieve individual responses, for example:
```twig
{% set contact = get('contacts') %}
<ul>
{% for contact in contacts %}
    <li>
        {{ contact.name }}: {{ contact.email }}
    </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
```
Where `contacts` is the alias for the following API request:
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '[{"alias":"contacts","method":"get.contacts","select":"name,email"}]' https://api.oggeh.com/?api_key=[APP_API_KEY]&lang=en
```
